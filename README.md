# Interactive Canvas

## Motivation
This project stemmed from the idea of not just creating a tool for drawing images, but adding a layer of interactivity to the drawn images. 

## Problem Solved
The core challenge this project addresses is enabling interactivity with drawn images. By allowing users to manipulate the images using a mouse, it brings a new level of interaction to the canvas.

## Learning Experience
Throughout this project, I delved into HTML to understand how to create a canvas that responds to user input. This involved learning about event handling and manipulation of elements within the HTML document. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into creating interactive web applications.
